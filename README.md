This repository contains various shaders that were made by me to develop my shader programming skills and also to show what I'm already capable of. The pack of shaders isn't complete and will be updated in the future with my next attempts at creating new shaders.

# Halftone
Effect that creates a binarized shadow in dotted patern, resembling a comicbook artstyle. Affected by the world light, with customizable color, intensity as well as the size of single dots.

# Water
Animated shader that imitates ocean waves. Reacting to world light, with many customizable parameters, like the number of waves, the Brownian effect, scatter of their direction, the amplitude and frequency, speed, as well as some light and color paremeters.

# Pixelation

On-screen shader that makes a pixelated effect with changable density. The screenshots show previous ocean shader with different pixelation density.
